Welcome to our team's OSC MiniHack project!

We've created a "Brainrot Translator" program with the following functionality:
  * Brainrot Translator: Takes input of brainrot terms/words/phrases, and translates it into casual language (for older people who might not be in touch with Gen Z terminology).
  * Professional translator: Brainrot translation into formal and professional language for better communication in professional settings.
  * Brainrot Teacher: Describes the meaning of brainrot words, including time period, historical context, and sample usage, for educational purposes.

Usage/implementation:
  * The code base can be set up like XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
  * To use, simply run the program and follow the user-friendly inputs.

Measurable impact:
  * To measure the impact of our project, we simply take the percent of words/phrases of the user's input which are considered "brainrot"
  * Once the input has been translated, the percent brainrot is the percent increase in sentence comprehensibility for the user.
  * This measurable positive impact in a person's life means that older people and young people alike can communicate more effectively with each other, and in a professional setting.
